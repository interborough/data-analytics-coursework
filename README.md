# Data Analytics Coursework
Homework assignments from my Data Analytics class (CSCI 381) at CUNY Queens College. These assignments were completed using Juypter Notebooks, and various Python libraries (Pandas, Numpy, Sklearn, Seaborn, etc.). 

Homework 1 covers basic Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Homework 2 deals with creating Linear and Logistic Regression models based on a given dataset, Homework 3 relates to creating Support Vector Machines and Decision Tree models based on a given dataset, and the Final Project involves creating multiple models based on a real world dataset from start to finish, and selecting the best model using various performance metrics. 

These assignments have been uploaded for archival purposes. Naturally, please don't use them to cheat.
